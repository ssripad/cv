	abstract = {Electric mobility application design requires accurate and fast prediction of Li-ion battery performance and life. An emerging area of mobility enabled by electrification is electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOL) for urban air mobility (UAM). Design process, techno-economic analysis and the operation of on-board systems depend on the fast and accurate prediction of Li-ion battery performance and life. These models must be accurate for the unique use-case of UAM requiring high power at takeoff and landing, thereby, causing significant rise in battery cell temperature. In this work, we generate a battery performance and thermal dataset specific to eVTOL use-cases and develop a fast and accurate performance and degradation model around that dataset. We use a machine-learning based physics-informed battery performance model to break the typically observed accuracy-computing cost trade-off. We fit the aging parameters for each cycle in a given cell's lifetime, and then model the evolution of those parameters using a new approach that combines traditional physics-based models, consisting of SEI film growth, charge loss, and Li Plating, along with a neural network in a universal ordinary differential equations (u-ODEs) framework. The new approach provides a unique way to combine the extrapolative capability of physics-based models with the representation power of neural networks.},

Here, we use a vehicle dynamics model to evaluate the trade-off between automation and electric vehicle range and battery longevity. We find that automation will likely reduce electric vehicle range by 5–10\% for suburban driving and by 10–15\% for city driving. The effect on range is strongly influenced by sensor drag for suburban driving and computing loads for city driving. The impact of automation on battery longevity is negligible. While some commentators have suggested that the power and energy requirements of automation mean that the first automated vehicles will be gas–electric hybrids, our results suggest that this need not be the case if automakers can implement energy-efficient computing and aerodynamic sensor stacks.},

As such, while some commentators have suggested that the power and energy requirements of automation mean that the first automated vehicles (AVs) will be gas-electric hybrids, we conclude that this need not be the case.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04822},
	abstract = {Electric Vehicles (EVs), like all modern vehicles, are entirely controlled by electronic devices embedded within networks that are exposed to the threat of cyberattacks. Cyber vulnerabilities are magnified with EVs due to unique risks associated with EV battery packs. Current batteries have well-known issues with specific energy, cost and fire-related safety risks. In this study, we develop a systematic framework to assess the impact of cyberattacks on EVs. While the current focus of automotive cyberattacks is on short-term physical safety, it is crucial to consider long-term cyberattacks that aim to cause financial losses through accrued impact, especially in the context of EVs. Faulty components of battery management systems such as a compromised voltage regulator could lead to cyberattacks that can overdischarge or overcharge the battery. Overdischarge could lead to failures such as internal shorts in the timescale of minutes through cyberattacks that compromise energy-intensive EV subsystems like auxiliary components. Attacks that overcharge the pack could shorten the lifetime of a new battery pack to less than a year. Further, such attacks also pose physical safety risks via the triggering of thermal (fire) events. Attacks on auxiliary components lead to battery drain, which could be up to 20\% of the state-of-charge per hour. Lastly, we develop a heuristic for the stealthiness of a cyberattack to augment traditional threat models. The methodology presented here will help in building the foundational principles of electric vehicle cybersecurity: a nascent but critical topic in the coming years.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Modern aircraft designs for “more electric” and “fully electric” aircraft have large battery packs ranging from tens of kWh for urban aviation to hundreds or thousands of kWh for commercial aviation. Such large battery packs require careful consideration of the safety concerns unique to aviation. The most pertinent safety concerns related to batteries can be categorized into two broad areas: exothermic heat related events (thermal issues) and partial or complete loss of safety–critical power supply (functional issues). Degradation during operation of a battery can contribute to capacity fade, increased internal resistance, power fade, and internal short circuits, which lead to the loss of or decrease in propulsive power. When batteries are the primary source of onboard power and energy, it is crucial to be able to estimate their state-of-health in terms of capacity and power capability. Internal short circuits and other sources of excessive heat generation can lead to high temperatures within the cells of a battery pack leading to safety concerns and thermal events. One of the biggest risk factors for batteries used in aviation is the potential for thermal runaway where temperatures reach the flashpoint of one of the cell components, eventually cascading over multiple cells leading to system-wide battery pack failure and a fire hazard. This article reviews the current understanding of the safety concerns related to batteries in the context of urban and regional electric aviation.},
